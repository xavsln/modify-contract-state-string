# Sample Hardhat Project

This is a simple project that makes use of Hardhat.
I comes with a contract that allows to store a string variable and a function to change it.

It also includes scripts to 1/ deploy the contract, 2/ get the variable value and 3/ change the variable value.

Finally, tests are provided for each functionality.
